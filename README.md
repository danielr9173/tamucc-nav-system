Traversing the TAMUCC campus can be quite cumbersome for newcomers. Going from the Turtle Cove parking lot to the Michael and Karen O’Connor Building can be a confusing ordeal for the inexperienced TAMUCC student, involving a myriad of wrong turns to unwanted paths that lead to anywhere but the intended destination. While the TAMUCC website offers a map that lists each parking lot and building, this map can be hard to follow.In using this map, (which can be found here: https://www.tamucc.edu/about/location/assets/tamucc-campus-map.pdf) the user must determine where they are currently located, and then must figure out which buildings they’re near via a number-based key located on the left hand side of this map. They must iterate through this process while walking, sometimes choosing the wrong way to go, until they arrive at their intended destination. The system we intend to develop streamlines this process.
